To solve the unexpected color issue, we need to understand CSS specificity and adjust the selectors appropriately. One solution is to increase the specificity of the rule targeting the class by adding a more specific parent selector or by using more classes or IDs to make it higher in specificity compared to the ID selector. Another approach could be rethinking the CSS structure to avoid conflicts by removing the ID and relying solely on class selectors to determine the styling of the element.

Here's an example of a solution demonstrating one way to achieve the desired 'red' color by increasing the specificity of the class selector: 

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement .myClass {
  color: red; /*This selector now has higher specificity than #myElement */
}
```

Another solution would be to remove the id selector and use only classes to make styling more predictable.

```css
.myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

.myElement.myClass {
  color: red;
}
```
